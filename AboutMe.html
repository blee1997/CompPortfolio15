				About Me
			</h2>
				<p>										
					My name is Brian Lee and I am a senior at Summit Preparatory High School.
					I transferred into summit after my sophomore year. 
					Before I went to summit, I was a student at Sequoia for my freshman and sophomore year.
					In my free time, I play the guitar and the ukulele.
					I have been teaching myself how to play these instruments and still continue to this day.
					
				</p>
					I was born in the United States but then moved to the Philippines when I was about 3 months old to live with my Aunt. 
					I went to Nursery school there and then started elementary school here in the United States at the age of 6.
					At first, I did not know English fluently so I would communicate with the other students and teachers with some broken English and many gestures.
