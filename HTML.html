				HTML
			</h2>
				<body>
					<p>
						HTML stands for <em>Hyper text Mark up Language</em> used in coding as a standardize system for tagging text files to change the font, color, appearance, and hyper link effects.
						This is the building blocks to creating websites because a web browser reads HTML and CSS codes to create visual and audio effects.
						In 1991, HTML tagging was refined by Tim Berners-Lee who was a contractor or a company called CERN.
					</>
			<h2>
				How HTML works
			</h2>
					<p>
						HTML works with commands in a text document.
						To tell that you are doing a command, you would put it in  <,> brackets. 
						For example if I wanted to create a large heading, I would do <h.1> then type what ever I want after the command.
						To end the command, you would put a <strong>forward slash</strong> (/) to tell that the command is done. 
						The whole code would look as so, (h1) type what ever you want here(/h1) but replace the (,) with <,>
					</p>
			<h2>
				What is CSS
			</h2>
					<p>
						Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language.
						This is usually used to design a website.
						Using the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/box-model.gif">Box model</a> as a reference, many web designers can create millions of different layouts for a single website.
						CSS is written differently compared to html. 
						CSS requires groups or specific ids to know which one you are trying to change. 
						For example, you would start off a CSS code with the thing you are trying to change. 
						Then follow up with a Bracket {,} to open it then a closed bracket at the end when you are done with the command.

					</p>
			<h2>
				Tags
			</h2>
					<p>
						Tags or commands are used to communicate with the computer to tell it what is needs to do.
						It is writen inbetween 2 brackets for example, < example command...>
						in between those brackets, you would put a certain phrase or word to initiate the command. 
						One of the most common command is the P command or Paragraph. 
						It is writen as < P > some working here and close it off with(/p) where you replace the (,) with <,>
					</p>
			<h2>
				Attributes
			</h2>
				<p>
				<ul>
					<li>HTML elements can have attributes</li>
					<li>Attributes provide additional information about an element</li>
					<li>Attributes are always specified in the start tag</li>
					<li>Attributes come in name/value pairs like: name="value"</li>
				</ul>
					<table border="1" style width="100%">
						<thead>
							<tr>
								<td>This sets a language for the website.</td>
								<td>Sets a title for your paragraph. </td>
								<td>A way to link a website</td>
								<td>A way to put a picture into your website.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>(html lang="en-US")</td>
								<td>(p title="About W3Schools")</td>
								<td>(a href="http://www.w3schools.com")</td>
								<td>(img src="w3schools.jpg" width="104" height="142")</td>
							</tr>
							replace all (,) with <,>
						</thead>
